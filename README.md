# MoodMate – Your AI-Powered Emotional Wellness Companion

MoodMate is an AI journaling assistant designed to help students reflect on their emotional well-being. Using natural language processing, it detects emotional tone in daily journal entries and provides personalized suggestions to support mental health.

> “MoodMate isn’t just about journaling—it’s about being heard, even when you can’t explain how you feel.”

## Inspiration

Mental health challenges are growing among teens and students, especially in high-stress academic environments. Journaling helps—but many young people don’t know how to articulate what they feel. **MoodMate bridges this gap**, giving students a safe, intelligent space to explore emotions and receive wellness guidance.

## What It Does

-  Accepts free-form journal entries  
-  Detects emotions (joy, sadness, fear, anger, love, surprise)  
-  Returns confidence scores for each emotion  
-  Offers personalized self-care tips  
-  Logs journal entries and emotions for trend analysis (CSV-based)

MoodMate is lightweight, intuitive, and designed to support emotional growth in students—without overwhelming them.
